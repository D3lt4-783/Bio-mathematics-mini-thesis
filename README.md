Mitochondrial Network Adjacency Matrix Generator

This repository contains 2 python scripts and their respective notebooks, and 1 R script.

"maincode.py" is the code used for all data gathering of the TIFF files. However, the TIFF files are far too large to upload to github.
Hence, the need for "examplecode.py". This takes in "MAX_C2-6Ge_1.1-2(Skel).jpg". For the code to work, make sure to change the path to read in the image on line 141.

The R script was used for all data analysis and produces the figures used in the thesis. It reads in all the .xlsx files in the "All Data" folder. For the code to work, set your working directory in R to the "All Data" directory.
